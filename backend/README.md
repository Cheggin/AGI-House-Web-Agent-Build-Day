> - pretty much the entire backend is mocked... but making this a full end-to-end app is on the to-do list. 
> - the biggest functionality the backend has right now is using browser use to fill out the rochester regional health application form with mock data. this should be extendable with some work. 
> - i'll be working on this continuously, so if you have any suggestions or edits, feel free to send a PR or open an issue!
