# Job Use Backend
hey, this is shawn! welcome to the job-use backend...

> ## setup
> - create and activate a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
> - run `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
> - run the backend server with `python api.py`

## updates

> ### september 29, 2024
> - pretty much the entire backend is mocked... but making this a full end-to-end app is on the to-do list. 
> - the biggest functionality the backend has right now is using browser use to fill out the rochester regional health application form with mock data. this should be extendable with some work. 
> - i'll be working on this continuously, so if you have any suggestions or edits, feel free to send a PR or open an issue!
